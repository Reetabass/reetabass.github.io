## üìå Problem / Motivation

I developed Better-Us AI ‚Äî a web-based application designed to help users improve communication in personal relationships. The system integrates OpenAI's GPT API to analyze user-submitted messages and suggest improved phrasing based on psychological communication principles. My goal was to apply modern backend development techniques while integrating AI-powered language models into a scalable, secure, and database-driven web platform.

This project allowed me to expand my skills into cloud deployment, full-stack API design, user authentication, and relational database management, while also exploring applied NLP use cases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

- **Frontend:** Built using React for user interaction, form submissions, and profile management.
- **Backend API:** FastAPI framework used to handle RESTful endpoints, GPT API calls, and business logic.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and session management handled via Clerk authentication platform.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL relational database used to store user profiles, communication preferences, and chat history.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT API utilized for real-time message analysis, rewriting, and coaching suggestions.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on AWS with scalable architecture to handle concurrent users and persistent storage.

## üß™ Key Technical Challenges

- Designing efficient database schemas for dynamic user profile data.
- Securing API endpoints while integrating third-party authentication flows.
- Handling asynchronous GPT API calls and ensuring consistent user experience.
- Managing state across multiple user sessions and preserving data consistency.
- Deploying backend and frontend components to AWS with proper configuration for scaling and stability.

## üöÄ Future Work & Expansion

- Add support for partner-linked profiles for relationship-specific communication adjustments.
- Implement natural language processing (NLP) models for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.
- Expand AI coaching models to support multiple languages and cultural contexts.
- Add subscription-based features using Stripe integration for monetization.
- Build analytics dashboard for users to track communication improvement over time.
