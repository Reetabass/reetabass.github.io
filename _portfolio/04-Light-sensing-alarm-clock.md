Built a real-time embedded system that:

- Uses ADC to read light levels
- Activates alarm when light threshold is reached
- Uses sonar distance measurement to silence alarm via hand wave
- USART integration for serial debugging

**Technologies:** AVR C, Timer1 Input Capture, Analog Comparator, ADC, USART
